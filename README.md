# YouTube Trending Video Analytics

The repo consists of visualizations in D3.js (Observable) and Tableau for videos from YouTube's [API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/list) for trending videos in the US. Refer to this [repository](https://github.com/mitchelljy/Trending-YouTube-Scraper) to scrape data using the public API. The visualizations are created using raw statistics from the dataset, along with derived attributes like sentiment scores to gain more insight.

## Motivation
* Visualizations on trending YouTube video data that help narrow down key indicators that makes a video popular, and helps stay on YouTube's trending list. 

* What makes trending YouTube videos more engaging than others? How can content creators better make use of data to create high-performing videos that go viral? 

## Dataset
Download the CSV file for the dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wl5EkJOUrZGluVk_wjn1itU-sNQuS7LF/view?usp=share_link).

This is a cleaned version of the scraped data, and NLTK's [SentimentAnalyzer](https://www.nltk.org/howto/sentiment.html) is used to derive sentiment scores (ranging from -1 to 1) for videos, which are added to the CSV file as an additional feature.

Each entry in the dataset corresponds to a trending video with features such as -
Title,
Trending Date,
Published Date,
Channel Title,
Category ID,
Tags,
Description,
Views,
Likes,
Dislikes,
Comments, and
Comment Count.

## Visualizations
* Net popularity vs. sentiment score
* Category based interactive visualization
* Category-wise analysis of sentiment scores
* Trend analysis of sentiment scores
* Correlation for raw video statistics ...
